DEBUG: Feedback data: {'summary': "The student's golf swing exhibits several critical biomechanical issues, particularly in timing, rotation, and arm positions, which hinder overall performance. The swing is characterized by a lack of proper tempo, insufficient chest and X-factor rotation, and suboptimal trail elbow positioning, all of which need immediate attention.", 'priority_issues': ['Tempo Ratio: A tempo ratio of 1.29:1 is significantly below the target of 3.00:1. This indicates a rushed swing that can lead to inconsistent ball striking and reduced power.', "Chest Turn (at top): The chest turn of 49.0° is far from the target of 85.0°. Insufficient rotation limits the golfer's ability to generate clubhead speed and power, leading to a less effective swing.", 'X-Factor (at top): An X-factor of 9.9° is well below the ideal of 50.0°. This lack of separation between the upper and lower body restricts the potential for torque, resulting in diminished power transfer to the ball.', 'Trail Elbow (at top): The trail elbow angle of 30.7° is not within the desired range of 70.0°-130.0°. This angle affects the swing path and can lead to inconsistencies in ball flight.', 'Head Drop Cm: A head drop of -6.6 cm is outside the range of -0.030 to 0.030. This indicates excessive head movement downwards during the swing, which can disrupt the swing plane and impact consistency.', 'Head Rise Cm: A head rise of -18.6 cm is significantly off from the target range. This indicates that the head is moving too much upward during the swing, further destabilizing the posture and swing mechanics.'], 'drills': [{'title': 'Tempo Drill: 3:1 Ratio', 'description': "Practice your swing tempo by counting '1-2-3' on the backswing and '1' on the downswing.
