A poor tempo can disrupt the timing of your swing, affecting both power and accuracy.', 'Early Extension: This is rated red, which is critical to address. Early extension causes loss of power because it reduces your ability to maintain posture through impact, leading to inconsistent strikes and loss of distance.', 'Transition: The transition from backswing to downswing is marked yellow. A poor transition can lead to timing issues and a less effective swing path, negatively impacting your ball flight.'], 'drills': [{'title': 'Slow Motion Swing Drill', 'description': "To improve tempo, practice your full swing in slow motion. Focus on making a smooth and controlled transition from the top of your backswing to your downswing. Count '1' for the backswing, '2' for the transition, and '3' for impact. This drill helps you develop a consistent rhythm and ensures that your movements are properly timed."}, {'title': 'Wall Drill for Early Extension', 'description': 'Stand about 1 foot away from a wall with your back facing it. Set up as you would for a shot, then make a backswing. As you start your downswing, focus on maintaining your posture and avoiding your hips moving towards the wall too soon. This drill reinforces the proper hip motion and helps prevent early extension.'}, {'title': 'Pause at the Top Transition Drill', 'description': 'During practice swings, pause for a moment at the top of your backswing before starting your downswing. This drill allows you to feel the correct transition and ensures that you’re not rushing into your downswing.
